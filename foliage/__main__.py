__main__.py: main function for foliage.

User interface design
---------------------

Foliage runs locally as a Python application, but it opens a web page in the
user's default web browser to use as a user interface.  Foliage does this via
PyWebIO, a framework for building browser-based synchronous GUI applications.
The page has familiar GUI elements like page tabs, buttons, and input forms.

The main Foliage application also starts a separate graphical interface written
in PyQT to put a widget in the taskbar (on Windows) or system tray (on macOS),
This widget provides a visual indication to the user that Foliage is still
running, and also provides a single menu item, "Quit", that allows the user to
quit Foliage.  It's an alternative to using the "Quit" button in the main
Foliage window or closing the window, in case the user has done something to
hide or lose track of the Window.  On Windows, the PyQT widget runs in a thread
but on macOS, it must run as a separate process spawned by Foliage.  The macOS
requirement is a result of how macOS's graphical framework works; the issues
are explained in the file "system_widget.py" in this directory.

The PyWebIO framework does its magic by running a web server on the user's
machine.  Foliage uses Tornado as the web server, mainly because Tornado
supports a useful feature during development: auto-reloading Foliage files
when they've been edited.  However, the PyWebIO interface to Tornado lacks a
critical feature needed by Foliage to implement a proper "Quit" capability
(which is a significant problem, because being able to quit the app is kind
of an important thing). The copy of PyWebIO currently used by Foliage is a
modified version PyWebIO 1.5.2; the modification solves a problem I was having
in which PyWebIO could not detect that the user has closed the application
window.  I'm submitting a pull request to PyWebIO that I hope will mean future
versions of PyWebIO will provide the feature and Foliage won't have to use a
fork in the future.

The main event loop for user interaction is implemented in the Foliage function
foliage_page() in this file.  This function populates the web page (calling
on functions in other files to create the elements on the various tabs) and
then ends with a "while True" loop.  The loop periodically checks whether
certain GUI elements have changed state (such as certain buttons being pressed)
and if not, goes back to waiting for a change in state.  Most of the tabs in
Foliage actually don't need to be engaged in this loop, because they set up
buttons to trigger functions if the user presses the button.  However, not
everything can be done that way, plus we need to check the state of the widget
mentioned above and that needs to be done by polling.

FOLIO user credentials
----------------------

The typical scenario expected for Foliage is that the first time the user
starts it, it will ask the user for credentials, store a token in the user's
private system keychain, and then on subsequent starts, Foliage will read the
token the keychain instead of asking the user again.  The information Foliage
needs is a FOLIO tenant id, FOLIO URL, and (once only to create a token) the
user's FOLIO login and password; it does not store the user login and password
because it only needs the token, tenant id and URL.

For flexibility and to support other scenarios, Foliage actually supports
multiple ways of providing the credentials:

  1. If the command line argument --creds-file is used, and the given file
     contains the credentials (OKAPI URL, tenant id, and OKAPI API token), then
     those credentials are used and nothing more is tried. (In other words,
     credentials given via --creds-file override everything else.) If the
     given file cannot be read or does not contain complete credentials, then
     it is an error and Foliage will quit.

  2. Else, if all three of the environment variables FOLIO_OKAPI_URL,
     FOLIO_OKAPI_TENANT_ID and FOLIO_OKAPI_TOKEN are set, it uses those
     credentials and nothing more is tried.

  3. Else, it looks up the credentials in the user's system keyring/keychain.
     If all 3 pieces of info are found (i.e., OKAPI URL, tenant id, and OKAPI
     API token), then those credentials are used.

  4. Else, it asks the user for the FOLIO_OKAPI_URL, FOLIO_OKAPI_TENANT_ID, a
     FOLIO login, and a password, and uses that combination to request an API
     token from FOLIO. Unless the --no-keyring argument is given, Foliage also
     stores the URL, tenant id, and token in the user's keyring/keychain so
     that it doesn't have to ask again in future runs. (The user's login and
     password are not stored.)

FOLIO API
---------

Calls to the FOLIO API are encapsulated in folio.py and credentials.py.
This main function doesn't interact directly with FOLIO except during the
initial startup when it deals with user credentials.  The calls to FOLIO are
mostly all made by the various tab functions.

Debug log
---------

Unlike some other applications I've written, Foliage always writes a log file.
The file can be accessed by the user from the "Other" tab.  The location of
the file is set to a default application-specific location unless the user
sets it explicitly to another destination using the command-line argument
--debug.  Using the command-line argument is the only way to set it; the GUI
does not provide a way to change the location.  (This is done on purpose;
changing the log destination is something only advanced users or developers
should do.  For normal users, we want the output to go to a known and reliable
location, so that it's findable in case it's needed to help solve problems
that users may be experiencing.)

Backup directory
----------------

Before destructive operations are made on records in FOLIO, Foliage saves a
copy of the record as it existed before the change is performed.  It saves it
in an application-specific directory.  Similar to the case of the debug log
destination, the backup directory can also be changed via a command-line
argument, --backup-dir.  For similar reasons to those discussed above for the
debug flag, there is no GUI facility to change the location of the backup dir.
It can only be done via the command line interface.

Foliage (FOLIo chAnGe Editor) is a tool to do bulk changes in FOLIO. It allows
a user to look up records of various kinds, perform bulk changes in the values
of record fields, delete records, and more. It communicates with a FOLIO server
using the OKAPI network API.

FOLIO credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Credentials for FOLIO OKAPI access can be provided in a number of ways. The
sequence of methods it uses are as follows:

  1. If the --creds-file argument is used, and the given file contains
     complete credentials (OKAPI URL, tenant id, and OKAPI API token), then
     those credentials are used and nothing more is tried. (In other words,
     credentials given via --creds-file override everything else.) If the
     given file cannot be read or does not contain complete credentials, then
     it is an error and Foliage will quit.

  2. Else, if all three of the environment variables FOLIO_OKAPI_URL,
     FOLIO_OKAPI_TENANT_ID and FOLIO_OKAPI_TOKEN are set, it uses those
     credentials and nothing more is tried.

  3. Else, the credentials are looked up in the user's system keyring/keychain.
     If all 3 pieces of info are found (i.e., OKAPI URL, tenant id, and OKAPI
     API token), then those credentials are used.

  4. Else, it asks the user for the FOLIO_OKAPI_URL, FOLIO_OKAPI_TENANT_ID, a
     FOLIO login, and a password, and uses that combination to request an API
     token from FOLIO. Unless the --no-keyring argument is given, Foliage also
     stores the URL, tenant id, and token in the user's keyring/keychain so
     that it doesn't have to ask again in future runs. (The user's login and
     password are not stored.)

In normal situations, the first time a user runs Foliage, they will end up in
case #4 above (i.e., being asked for credentials so that Foliage can create
and store an API token), and then on subsequent runs, Foliage will not ask for
the credentials again.

The form of the interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although Foliage is a desktop application and not a web service, it uses a
web page as its user interface -- it opens a page in a browser on your
computer, letting you interact with the program through the familiar elements
of a web page. All the while, Foliage runs locally on your computer. When you
start Foliage normally (or after it shows the one-time credentials screen,
described below), your browser should present a page that has the title
"Foliage" and is organized into five areas of functionality accessed by
clicking on the row of tabs near the top: (1) "Look up records" (the first
one shown when Foliage starts up), (2) "Change records", (3) "Delete
records", (4) "List UUIDs", and (5) "Other".

Taskbar/menubar widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Foliage starts up, it provides an icon in the Windows taskbar or the
macOS system tray (depending on your operating system). The icon serves as a
reminder that Foliage is running, and offers a single menu option (for
quitting Foliage). The menu is accssed by right-clicking the widget on
Windows or left-clicking it on macOS.

To prevent the startup of the widget process, run Foliage with the --no-widget
command-line option.

Additional command-line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default port for the local web server started by Foliage is 8080.  To
change this port, you can use the option --port followed by a port number.

If given the -V option, this program will print the version and other
information, and exit without doing anything else.

If given the -@ argument, this program will output a detailed trace of what it
is doing. The debug trace will be sent to the given destination, which can
be '-' to indicate console output, or a file path to send the output to a file.
