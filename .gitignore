#
# The approach we suggest is to add ONLY project-specific rules here. Put
# rules that apply to your way of doing things (and the particular tools you
# happen to use) into a global git ignore file as described in the section
# "Configuring ignored files for all repositories on your computer" here:
# https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files
# (accessed on 2022-07-14). For example, Emacs checkpoint and backup files are
# things that are not specific to a given project; rather, Emacs users will
# see them created everywhere, in all projects, because they're a byproduct
# of using Emacs, not a consequence of working on a particular project. Thus,
# they belong in a user's global ignores list, not in this project .gitignore.
#
# A useful starting point for global .gitignore file contents can be found at
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global (as of 2022-07-14).
