Foliage (_**Foli**o ch**a**n**g**e **E**ditor_) is a desktop computer application that can perform operations in [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org), a library services platform ([LSP](https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5686/7063)) used by Caltech and other institutions. Foliage allows a user to look up records of various kinds, perform bulk changes in the values of record fields, delete records, and more. It communicates with a FOLIO server using the [OKAPI network API](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md). The program is cross-platform compatible and currently in use on Windows and macOS computers at the Caltech Library.
