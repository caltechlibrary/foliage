## Introduction

Foliage (_**Foli**o ch**a**n**g**e **E**ditor_) is a desktop computer application that can perform operations in [FOLIO](https://www.folio.org), a library services platform ([LSP](https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/5686/7063)) used by Caltech and other institutions. Foliage allows a user to look up records of various kinds, perform bulk changes in the values of record fields, delete records, and more. It communicates with a FOLIO server using the [OKAPI network API](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md). The program is cross-platform compatible and currently in use on Windows and macOS computers at the Caltech Library.

</p>

Although Foliage is a desktop application and not a web service, it uses a web page as its user interface &ndash; it opens a page in a browser on the user's computer, letting the user interact with the program through the familiar elements of a web page. This lets Foliage present an identical user interface no matter whether it is running on Window, macOS, or Linux.

## Installation

There are multiple ways of installing Foliage, ranging from downloading a self-contained, single-file, ready-to-run program, to installing it as a typical Python program using `pip`.  Please choose the alternative that suits you.


### _Alternative 1: installing the ready-to-run executable programs_

For the Caltech Library, we provide Foliage in a ready-to-run form for Windows computers. This is the easiest and preferred way of getting a copy of Foliage. Please contact the author for more information.


### _Alternative 2: installing Foliage using `pip`_

The instructions below assume you have a Python 3 interpreter installed on your computer.  Note that the default on macOS at least through 10.14 (Mojave) is Python **2** &ndash; please first install Python version 3 and familiarize yourself with running Python programs on your system before proceeding further.

You should be able to install `foliage` with [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for Python&nbsp;3.  To install `foliage` from the [Python package repository (PyPI)](https://pypi.org), run the following **two** commands:
```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/mhucka/PyWebIO.git@2af53fc
python3 -m pip install foliage
```

_If you already installed Foliage once before_, and want to update to the latest version, add `--upgrade` to the ends the commands above.


### _Alternative 3: installing Foliage from sources_

If  you prefer to install Foliage directly from the source code, you can do that too. To get a copy of the files, you can clone the GitHub repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/foliage
```

Alternatively, you can download the files as a ZIP archive using this link directly from your browser using this link: <https://github.com/caltechlibrary/foliage/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>

Next, after getting a copy of the files,  run `setup.py` inside the code directory:
```sh
cd foliage
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/mhucka/PyWebIO.git@2af53fc
python3 setup.py install
```
