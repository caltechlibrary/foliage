# Windows installation info for Foliage

When you download the installer for Foliage from the Library Google Drive folder, your browser will produce security warnings because it doesn't recognize the origin and nature of the program. Foliage is safe to download and install if you get it from the Library's Google Drive. Here are the steps to get past the various Windows security warnings.

First, open on the Google Drive folder in your browser and right-click over the installer program's 
name. You will get a pop-up menu in which one of the choices is "Download". Select "Download".

After a short pause while Google automatically checks the file for viruses, you will get a dialog saying "This file type might be dangerous" and a button for "Download anyway". **Click "Download anyway"**.

What you need to do next will depend on the browser you are using.


## Google Chrome

Google Chrome will interrupt the download and show a warning in the bottom left of the browser window:

</p>

Do **not** click the "Discard" button. Instead, click the **⋁** symbol next to the bottom, and it will show a pop-up menu in which there is a "Keep" option. **Click "Keep"**.

Google Chrome will save the installer and you can proceed normally. (Find the installer where it was downloaded on your computer and start the installer program.)


## Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge will block the download and you may see a pop-up such as the following:

</p>

You must move your cursor to **hover over the Foliage item in the list**, at which point, the browser will show a trash can icon and three dots (•••). **Click on the three dots** to show the action menu, and **select "Keep"** from that menu:

</p>

You will get _yet another menu_ from which it is not obvious what to do:

</p>

Do **not** click "Delete". Instead, **click "Show more "** to get a list of options, from which you can **select "Keep anyway"**:

</p>

It is only at this point, _finally_, that the browser will actually download the Foliage installer program to your computer.
